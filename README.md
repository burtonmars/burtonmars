I'm a software developer with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (2022). My most relevant experience comes from my 1 year COOP as a full-stack developer followed by a 1+ year permanent position on the dev-ops team at Mitacs, a Canadian research and innovation nonprofit that was recognized as a key contributer to job creation during the pandemic by representatives at the highest level of the [Canadian government](https://pm.gc.ca/en/videos/2020/06/25/remarks-additional-support-students-and-recent-grads).

From starting my 1 year COOP internship in 2020 until recieving my Computer Science degree, I was mainly focused on contributing to Mitacs' client facing application portals via the Angular/Express/Node/MySql stack with feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security enhacements, as well as spending time on my hobbies: building PCs, penetration testing, and IOT devices. However, I have recently begun to explore other frameworks, libraries, and resources to expand my knowledge and experience. This is exemplefied here with my most recent projects.

I love problem solving and logic puzzles, but also honing my creativity and finding ways to make people's lives easier. I'm obsessed with everything technology and I am constantly looking for new hard-tech and software innovations. I am constantly learning and never willing to settle for the status-quo development practices simply because of their popularity. I am a fantastic team player who strives to combine best-practice coding with a hunger for innovation and to consistently push the boundries of any project to live up to the most cutting edge and relevant technologies and practices.
