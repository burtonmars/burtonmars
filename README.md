I'm a full stack developer with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (2022). My most relevant experience comes from my 1 year COOP followed by a 1+ year permanent position as a full stack developer on the devops team at Mitacs, a research and innovation focused Canadian gem that was recognized as a key contributer to job creation during the pandemic by representatives at the highest level of the [Canadian government](https://pm.gc.ca/en/videos/2020/06/25/remarks-additional-support-students-and-recent-grads).
