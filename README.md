### Hello!

<!--
**burtonmars/burtonmars** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software developer with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (2022). My most relevant experience is as a Full Stack developer at Mitacs. Mitacs is a Canadian research and innovation nonprofit that was recognized as a key contributer to job creation during the pandemic by representatives at the highest level of the [Canadian government](https://pm.gc.ca/en/videos/2020/06/25/remarks-additional-support-students-and-recent-grads).

At Mitacs, I was mainly focused on contributing to Mitacs' client facing application portals via the Angular/Express/Node/MySql stack with feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security enhacements, as well as spending time on my hobbies: building PCs, penetration testing, and IOT devices. I have also spent time exploring other frameworks, libraries, and resources with personal projects to expand my knowledge and experience. This is exemplefied here with my most recent github repos.

I love problem solving and logic puzzles, but also honing my creativity and finding ways to make people's lives easier. I'm obsessed with everything technology and I am always searching for new hardware and software innovations. I am constantly learning and always striving to not only abide by best software engineering practices, but to understand why they are best practices. I am a fantastic team player who strives to combine principle software design practices with innovative and creative solutions.
